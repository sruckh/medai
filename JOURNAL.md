### MedAI Project Initialization
- **What**: Created MedAI - FastAPI-based LLM proxy for medical chat applications
- **Why**: Enable seamless switching between Hugging Face TGI and RunPod vLLM providers for healthcare AI
- **How**: Built FastAPI application with provider abstraction, SSE streaming, and Docker deployment
- **Issues**: Initial API key exposure in commit (resolved with force push)
- **Result**: Functional SSE proxy supporting Intelligent-Internet/II-Search-4B model

### Repository Cleanup and Security
- **What**: Removed unwanted directories and files from GitHub repository
- **Why**: Clean repository structure and prevent accidental commits of sensitive files
- **How**: Updated .gitignore, removed tracked files with `git rm --cached`, force pushed clean commit
- **Issues**: Files were already tracked before .gitignore was updated
- **Result**: Repository now excludes .claude, .claude-flow, .serena, .superdesign, Dorota-256.jpg, GOALS.md

### Documentation Overhaul
- **What**: Comprehensive update of all project documentation files
- **Why**: Better represent the MedAI project and improve developer experience
- **How**: Updated README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILD.md, CLAUDE.md with project-specific content
- **Issues**: CLAUDE.md was generic Claude Flow documentation
- **Result**: All documentation now accurately reflects MedAI's FastAPI/SSE architecture and medical AI focus

### Architecture Documentation Enhancement
- **What**: Detailed architecture documentation with line numbers and code examples
- **Why**: Enable precise code navigation and understanding of system design
- **How**: Added exact line numbers for all major functions, component diagrams, and flow charts
- **Issues**: Previous documentation was template/generic
- **Result**: Developers can now navigate directly to specific code locations (e.g., `api/main.py:48-77`)

### Documentation Framework Implementation
- **What**: Implemented Claude Conductor modular documentation system
- **Why**: Improve AI navigation and code maintainability
- **How**: Used `npx claude-conductor` to initialize framework
- **Issues**: None - clean implementation
- **Result**: Documentation framework successfully initialized
